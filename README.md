# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes consumer shopping behavior to uncover trends, purchasing patterns, and factors influencing customer engagement and repeat purchases. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Business Objective
To help a retail business:
- Identify key drivers of customer purchasing behavior  
- Understand differences across demographics, product categories, and sales channels  
- Improve customer engagement, loyalty, and marketing strategies  

## Dataset
The dataset contains consumer shopping records with attributes such as:
- Customer demographics
- Product categories and purchase details
- Payment methods and discount usage
- Purchase frequency and historical behavior

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy (data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering)
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL / MySQL (data modeling, querying, KPI analysis)
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visual analytics
- **Excel**: Data validation and exploratory checks

## Key Analysis & Metrics
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Purchase Frequency
- Repeat Purchase Rate
- Channel-wise performance (online vs offline)
- Impact of discounts, reviews, seasonality, and payment preferences

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values, inconsistent categories, and data type issues
   - Standardized fields and engineered analytical features

2. **Data Modeling & SQL Analysis**
   - Loaded cleaned data into a relational database
   - Queried customer segments, loyalty indicators, and purchase drivers

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed trends across demographics, categories, and channels
   - Identified behavioral patterns and key influencing factors

4. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Built interactive Power BI dashboards
   - Communicated KPIs and trends to support stakeholder decision-making

## Key Insights
- Identified customer segments with higher repeat purchase behavior
- Highlighted the role of discounts and reviews in influencing loyalty
- Revealed differences in engagement between online and offline channels
- Provided data-backed recommendations for targeted marketing strategies

## Deliverables
- Python scripts for data preparation and analysis
- SQL queries for business insights
- Power BI dashboard for interactive exploration
- Summary of insights and recommendations

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required Python libraries  
3. Run data cleaning and analysis scripts  
4. Load processed data into a SQL database  
5. Open the Power BI file to explore dashboards
